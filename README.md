Portfolio Site with multiple versions

This is my newest portfolio site redesign.
I focused on modern design trends, performance, and usability with this attempt.
I also made my own logo to emphasis moving forward with my skills and innovation.

On my update1 attempt, I wanted to use HTML5 video backgrounds and gradients to look like metal. Also went with more of an older design concept with my logo and overall feel as an experiment. - http://www.meinnovation.net/meinnovation_past/#/
